# PodScripter

**Transcribe your podcasts. No limits. No cloud.**

A Whisper-based CLI tool for creating podcast-ready .srt and .txt transcripts locally using Docker.

---

`podscripter` is a lightweight tool designed to transcribe audio using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model inside a Docker container. Popular languages such as English `en`, Spanish `es`, French `fr`, and German `de` are supported. Originally created for language learners, `podscripter` enables users to generate accurate transcriptions locally, perfect for platforms like [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/) where text + audio integration improves comprehension.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Local Processing**: No API keys or usage limits, run everything on your own machine.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Easily install and run the tool in an isolated container.
- **Flexible Output**: Choose your transcription language and model size.
- **Batch Transcription**: Transcribe multiple files with a simple loop.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Apple Mac with an M series processor.

## ðŸš€ Setup

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/algernon725/podscripter.git
  ```

3. Create the Docker volume folders to store your Docker-related files and audio inputs/outputs:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p podscripter/audio-files
  mkdir -p podscripter/models
  cd podscripter
  ```

4. Build the Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t podscripter .
  ```

5. Run the Docker container:
  ```bash
  docker run --platform linux/arm64 -it \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/root/.cache/whisper \
  -v $(pwd)/audio-files:/app/audio-files \
  podscripter
  ```

## ðŸ“„ Command-line Usage
*Please note that these commands need to be run from the command prompt inside of your running Docker container, which will appear after you run the Docker container in step 5 above.*

Usage: python transcribe_sentences.py <audio_file> <output_dir> [language (default 'es')] [model_size (default 'medium')] [output_format (txt|srt, default 'txt')]"

To transcribe an audio file named `example.mp3` from the command prompt inside the container:
  ```bash
  python transcribe_sentences.py audio-files/example.mp3 audio-files
  ```

For example, to transcribe an audio file named `example.mp3` containing Spanish speech, you can specify the language `es`:

  ```bash
  python transcribe_sentences.py audio-files/example.mp3 audio-files es
  ```

To transcribe an audio file named `example.mp3` containing French speech, with the `medium` model size, and output in `.srt` format, use:

  ```bash
  python transcribe_sentences.py audio-files/example.mp3 audio-files fr medium srt
  ```

## Command-Line Arguments

| Argument     | Description                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `audio_file` | Path to the audio file you want to transcribe                               |
| `output_dir` | Directory where the transcription will be saved                             |
| `language`   | (Optional) Output language code (`en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`) Default: `en` for English                 |
| `model_size` | (Optional) Whisper model size to use (`small.multilingual`, `medium`, `large-v2`, `large-v3`). Larger models are more accurate, but require more RAM and are slower. Default: `medium` requires ~5GB RAM|
| `output_format` | (Optional) Output format to use (`txt`, `srt`). Default: `txt`


## Batch Transcription (all `.mp3` files):
To transcribe all mp3 files from the command prompt inside the container:
  ```bash
  for f in audio-files/*.mp3; do
    python transcribe_sentences.py "$f" audio-files
  done
  ```

## ðŸ“š Why Use This?
When learning a new language, especially through podcasts, having accurate, aligned transcriptions is essential for comprehension and retention. Many language learning apps impose monthly transcription limits or rely on cloud-based AI. This tool gives you full control over your data, with no recurring costs, and the power of Whisper, all on your own hardware.

## ðŸ“¦ Output
Transcriptions are saved in sentence-separated `.txt` format, ready for import into language learning platforms.
